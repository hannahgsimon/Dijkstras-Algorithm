Graph traversal program with menu  
 1- Author Info  
 2- Load Graph  
 3- Traverse Graph  
 0- Exit  
Where:  
1 prints the program author info  
2 asks the user to enter a file name and loads the graph specified in the file  
3 asks for a starting node and then allows the user to travel around the graph. Informs the user of all neighbors and the cost of traveling to each neighbor, then lets the user pick a neighbor to travel to. As the user traverses the nodes, a total of the costs incurred by the chosen path is kept.  
0 exits the program

When traversing the graph, choose -1 to exit the traversal.  
If the user enters -2, the program uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path to all other vertices on the graph and print the paths to the screen.
